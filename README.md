### Hey there! 👋 I'm Daniel, a Data Enthusiast and recent graduate of BrainStation’s Data Science Bootcamp. 
My GitHub is currently a work in progress. I’ll be looking to add more projects that highlight some of the skills I’ve been learning these last few months.

#### About Me
My story starts in Estes Park, Colorado, where I've spent the last 15+ years helping run a family-owned brunch spot. This place taught me a lot about resilience and attention to detail—traits that I'm now channeling into my new passion: data science.

I'm a huge fan of exploring—whether that's hiking unknown trails, snowboarding fresh powder, or trying out new food spots, I'm all about diving into new experiences. These adventures keep my creativity buzzing and give me fresh perspectives, which I bring into my work.

After a deep dive into BrainStation's data science bootcamp, I'm all set to use my skills to dig into data and uncover insights that matter. Looking ahead, I'm super excited about getting into machine learning to see where data can really take us.

#### 🛠 Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scipy
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Big Data Technologies:** AWS, Hadoop, Spark
- **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, Regression Analysis

#### 📊 Projects
- **Urban Explorer: Machine Learning-Driven Discoveries**
  This project is all about turning what I love—discovering cool new spots and experiences—into something we can all use to make better choices about where to hang out and what to do. It uses machine learning to craft personal recommendations for dining and fun based on what you like. [Check it out](https://github.com/drojas-25/BrainStation-Capstone)

#### 📈 My Approach
I dive deep into data, play around with models, and always keep learning to make sure our digital solutions really hit the mark. My aim? To make data science down-to-earth and impactful, helping us all get more from our daily experiences.

#### 🌐 Let's Connect!
I love chatting with people who are as data-crazy and innovation-driven as I am. If you think we can spark some cool ideas together, let’s get in touch. You can hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielrojas25) or take a look at my projects
